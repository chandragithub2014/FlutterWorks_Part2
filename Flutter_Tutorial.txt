Flutter Adavantages:

Compiles to Native:
   Just in time compile
      Changes in code can be seen at the same time during development without recompilation.Write the code and see the results in device without recompile
   Ahead of time compile  
          Code is compiled during development so the device receives native code.
   Fast Development
   Great user experience
   Single code base for both Android and iOS.
   
   
   To develop app using we use language called Dart
   Its strongly typed language developed by Google.
   Dart is :
   Object Oriented
   Simple
   Familiar

   Starting Flutter app:
   Step 1 : Import material package  (import 'package:flutter/material.dart';)
   main() : Is the entry point    
   main() { 
    runApp( 
	
	 Center(child : Text ("Hello", TextDirection : ltr),
	 )
	);
   
   }
   
   
   main() : IS Entry Point
   runApp() :  Inflates the widget and attaches it to the screen
   Center and Text are widgets
   Note: When we use Text , we need to specify direction of the text which is TextDirection
   
   
   
   MaterialApp : Is container of all widgets. It contains "title" and a "body"
   Material    : Is a widget that contains properties to set  background of an app.
   Center      : Is a widget that displays all its child widgets in center
   Scaffold    : Is used to display appbar and set a title  to it using "Text" widget
   
   
   Basic Widgets used in Flutter:
   
   Container
   Text
   Row & Column
   Image
   Raised Button
   Alert Dialog
   Box Constraints
   Size, Margin and Padding
   AppBar
   Scaffold
   
   
 To Load image from Assets:
 Steps:
   (1) Create a separate folder in root with some name say "images"
   (2) Copy image which is png image into that folder.
   (3) Open pubspec.yaml file and uncomment "assets" section and update accordingly with image name.
   (4) Take care "assets" section has one Tab space.
   (5) Go to source file and access image from Assets as below in order to display in UI:
         AssetImage  burgerAsset = AssetImage('images/burger.png');
        Image image = new Image(image: burgerAsset,width: 200.0,height: 200.0);
		

State:
State is the information that can be read synchronously when the widget is built and might change during the lifetime of the widget.

Difference between stateless and stateful

Stateless:
Does not have a mutable state. Its immutable
overrides build() method.
Use when the UI depends on information in the object itself

Stateful:
Will have a mutable state
overrides the createState() method  and returns a state.
USe when UI change dynamically.


Steps to create Stateful widget:

1.  Create a class that extends a Stateful widget, which returns State.
2.  Create a state class with properties that may change.
3.  Implement the build() method
4.  call the setState() method to make changes.

In flutter multithreading is acheived using 
Future asycn await

Future: Future represents an object that gets sometime in the future.

Aync and Await:
Async and Await allows to write Asynchronous code that looks like synchronous code.
